    description: ` 
      Gartic.io is very easy to play but it is very difficult to be the # 1, in the game so you should learn how to play the game. 
      Following, basic rules for the game are detailed: Each player has a turn, in which s/he must draw the object and facilitate others to guess the right word given to him or her.
      Other players put the answers in the “answers” box, where the right answer is identified by the server, and the points are automatically added to the score of the player.
      A player can also guess on an object more than once in Garticio.
      All the players have the facility of the “Hint”. In the Hint, two to three first alphabets, middle alphabets, or last alphabets are shown. The Hint feature helps players greatly in guessing the right word.
      The players can also skip their turn if they do not want to draw.
      Players can discuss their confusions in the chatbox with other players, and get done with them.`,

    description: `Designate one player as the host. This person will manage categories and timers. 

        Use an online Scattergories list generator, like the one at Swellgarfo.com. The host can share their screen in Zoom. 
        Add or remove categories before you start playing, if desired. There’s a “make child-friendly” option if you have younger players. 
        The list generator also selects a letter at random. Tap on “re-roll” for a new letter.
        swellgarfo.com has a built-in timer function too. The default setting is 1,20 seconds per round, but you can change that.
        When you’re ready to start the first round, click “play.” The timer starts automatically.
        When you click “reset” or “restart,” you get a new letter and a new set of categories for the next round. 
        If you want to keep the same categories, click on “re-roll” for a new letter. You will need to use something else for your timer.`,

        Choose higher or lower to decide whether it is searched for more or less than the previous card. 
        The objective is to get the most right in a row. If you get one wrong, you lose the game.`,
