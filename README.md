# School of Code Dashboard Organisation App

## Brief

To create an app that will help with the organisational issues relating to the natioal scale-up of School of Code.

We narrowed this down to:

- Coach organisation
  - Daily energiser selection
  - Cohort grouping organisation
  - Ease of lecture recording access

- Bootcamper organisation
  - Reading list availability
  - Progress tracking
  - Ease of lecture recording access

## Strategy

We aim to work using Agile methodology whilst keeping the app users as the main focus of development.

Initially, we consulted with coaches to establish the main organisational issues with the School of Code national scale-up to establish our main app features. Following this, we used Disney Ideation (https://www.designorate.com/disneys-creative-strategy/) to decide on our final app. Wireframe designs were constucted and high-fidelity designs were created using Figma and the tech stack was chosen.

We decided on iterative releases and created our iteration 0 by deploying our front and back end and ensure the requests from the front end were correct. Iteration 1 was released and feedback was obtained using a google form. This feedback helped to direct our focus for the next sprint.

## App Overview

This app provides user-specifc dashboards for bootcamp coaches and bootcampers based upon user logins. These dashboards present relevant information to the user that will be obtained from a Serverless backend.
